# Testing with AI

Imagine if AI could test applications for us. Sounds great, right? But it’s not that simple.

So far, I’ve explored how language models can generate test scripts based on source code and instructions. It works for simple control tests—but real-world workflows are a different story. The model needs to learn how to use an application.

My next step? Train an open-source model to interact with an app and see if it can then generate meaningful test scripts. Will it work? Let’s find out together.
